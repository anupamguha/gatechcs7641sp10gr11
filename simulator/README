This code implements a simulator for the games in the IRC poker database.

To run the code:  java simulator.sim.Simulator -d <directory to IRC data> [-i]

The -i flag is optional.  If present, the code is run in an interactive fashion where
the actions and betting of a single game is printed to the console, then the simulation
prompts the user as to whether to run the next game.  Intended for testing.

Collected statistics are saved in the local data/ directory named for the state
they represent.  For example, plm.csv represents all collected data in the state of
<PREFLOP, LOW, MEDIUM>, where PREFLOP is the game phase, LOW is the pot percentage,
and MEDIUM is the stack percentage.

Each line of the data file is in the following format:
Phase, Pot%, Stack%, Check%, Bet%, Call%, Raise%, AvgBetAmt, AvgBetStdDev, AllIn%, Fold%, AvgFoldAmt

Where:
  Phase = PREFLOP, FLOP, TURN, RIVER -> the phase of the game
  Pot% = LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH -> the size of the pot relative to the chips on the table
  Stack% = LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH -> the size of the player's stack relative to the chips on the table

  Check% = percentage of time player checked when the game is in the given state
  Bet% = percentage of time player bet when the game is in the given state
  Call% = percentage of time player called when the game is in the given state
  Raise% = percentage of time player raised when the game is in the given state
  AvgBetAmt = average amount of chips the player bet when betting/raising/calling
  AvgBetStdDev = standard deviation of AvgBetAmt
  AllIn% = percentage of time player went all in -- due to dataset limitations, only calculated at RIVER phase
  Fold% = percentage of time player folded when the game is in the given state
  AvgFoldAmt = average amount of chips player would have had to play had they not decided to fold

The files/ directory consists of a small subset of data to be used in testing.  It is something that 
we can easily calculate statistics on and follow actions of to ensure that everything is 
being calculated/running correctly.  The actual test set used is available online at the IRC 
poker database website (http://games.cs.ualberta.ca/poker/IRC/IRCdata/) and is the tourney.200012.tgz
data file.
